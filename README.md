# Source Minimap

Source and Live Preview improvements over Nymbo/Markdown-Minimap 2.6.0:

- Live Preview preserves literal tabs, nested list depth and blank lines instead of collapsing them through the Reading view renderer. Common inline formatting hides its delimiters, except on active editor lines. Both editing modes use line-based navigation and actual editor folds.

- Stable full-note layout: scrolling no longer replaces minimap row heights with CodeMirror's provisional measurements.
- Navigation maps every source line, including notes without headings and wrapped lines.
- Track clicks target the text currently under the pointer. Subsequent dragging holds the viewport marker.
- Automatic right padding uses the measured minimap strip and the working `.cm-scroller { padding-right: …; box-sizing: border-box; }` rule. No pane-width, left-margin or clipping changes. **Make room for the minimap** is removed; old values are ignored. No new setting is needed.
- Tabs, whitespace, wrapping and letter spacing follow the editor's computed styles.
- A separate **Text opacity** setting defaults to 55%; background and marker opacity remain independent.
- Source edits refresh on the next animation frame. Actual CodeMirror fold ranges hide folded lines.

## Install with BRAT

Use `minhtritran/Markdown-Minimap` as the beta plugin repository after the release assets are published.
The separate plugin ID is `source-minimap`, so BRAT installs it into `.obsidian/plugins/source-minimap/` and leaves Markdown Minimap and its settings untouched. CSS classes, CSS variables, toolbar buttons and device preferences are also namespaced independently.
Both plugins can remain installed. Disable the original Markdown Minimap when using this fork so you do not display two minimaps in the same location.
Remove earlier minimap CSS overrides for fixed widths, padding, line heights or opacity before testing this version.

## Verification and limits

`npm ci && npm test && npm run build` runs the regression tests, TypeScript checks and release-file validation.
Tests cover line mapping in both directions, wrapped lines, changing editor height estimates, folds, click/drag navigation and scroll endpoints.
`node tests/layout-fixture.mjs` writes `/tmp/minimap-layout.html`, a browser fixture for resize, tab and wrapping checks. It uses representative editor markup, not Obsidian itself.

This release has **not been visually verified inside Obsidian**. Editing modes use a separate line renderer with Markdown/Prism highlighting, not a pixel-for-pixel clone of CodeMirror. Live Preview supports common inline formatting; rich embeds, tables, math, callouts, code fences and frontmatter remain source-like in the minimap. Nested inline formatting, theme-specific hanging list indentation and third-party decorations may differ. Reading mode retains the upstream renderer. Very large notes still create one DOM row per source line.

Before relying on it, check a long note in Source mode: scroll through new sections and pause; click text in the middle/bottom of the minimap; drag its marker; fold/unfold headings and lists; resize the pane; switch modes; and toggle the plugin off/on to verify the editor layout stays unchanged.

## Upstream documentation

The original project and attribution are retained below. References to upstream installation/release URLs and the old Make room setting below describe the original plugin, not this fork with automatic scroller padding.

# 🗺️ Markdown Minimap

A minimap for your Markdown notes, inside the editor pane. Like the minimap in
a code editor, it gives you a scaled-down view of the whole note so you can see
its shape and jump anywhere in it.

## Why this one

Most minimap implementations clone the editor's DOM, which means they only ever
capture the part of the note that is currently on screen — Obsidian virtualizes
long notes, so past a certain length the minimap stops being a usable scrollbar.

Markdown Minimap renders the whole note independently, and spends most of its
effort on a harder problem: making the minimap agree with the note. The panel is
laid out at the note's own text width, margins, line height and font, and the
scroll position is mapped through anchors shared by both, rather than by
scaling the document by a single ratio. On a 14,000-word note that is the
difference between the viewport marker landing where you expect and landing 150
pixels away.

## 📦 Installation

### From Community Plugins

`Settings` → `Community Plugins` → `Browse` → search for **Markdown Minimap** →
`Install`, then `Enable`.

### Manually

Download `main.js`, `manifest.json` and `styles.css` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/Nymbo/Markdown-Minimap/releases) and put
them in `<your vault>/.obsidian/plugins/markdown-minimap/`.

## 🧪 Usage

Open any note and the minimap appears at the right edge of the pane.

- **Click** anywhere on it to jump to that point
- **Drag** the viewport marker to scroll continuously
- **Scroll** over it with the wheel to scroll the note
- **Toggle** it per note with the button in the note header, or bind
  `Toggle minimap for current note` to a hotkey

The viewport marker has three states, mirroring a code editor: barely visible at
rest, legible when the pointer is over the minimap, and strongest while you are
dragging it.

## ⚙️ Settings

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Disable on this device | Hides the minimap on this device only. Stored outside the synced settings file, so your phone and your desktop can disagree |
| Enable by default | Whether new notes open with the minimap shown |
| Scale | Size of the minimap, 0.05–0.3 of actual size |
| Opacity | Background opacity of the minimap panel |
| Slider opacity | Viewport marker opacity while hovering the minimap; the dragging state scales from it |
| Idle slider opacity | Viewport marker opacity the rest of the time; set it to 0 to hide the marker until you hover |
| Top / bottom offset | Clearance for plugin toolbars or bottom chrome |
| Scrollbar gap | Distance between the minimap and the editor's scrollbar |
| Minimum viewport height | Floor for the viewport marker, so it stays grabbable in long notes |
| Make room for the minimap | Moves the note's text so the space either side of it stays even once the minimap has taken its strip. On by default |
| Center on click | Whether clicking the minimap centres the viewport on that point, or puts it at the top. Dragging the marker is unaffected |

### 💡 Giving the minimap room

**Make room for the minimap** is on by default. It measures the gap on either
side of the text — from the pane's left edge, and from the text to the minimap —
and shifts by half their difference, so the two come out equal at any zoom, font
size or screen. There is no number to type in and no unit to get wrong.

The text moves into the file margin as well as the readable line length margin,
and it is never pushed past the pane's own left edge. On a narrow pane there may
not be enough room to make the gaps fully equal; the text moves as far as it can
without being clipped, so it can still end up partly under the minimap. A wider
pane, `Settings` → `Editor` → `Readable line length`, or a smaller **Scale**
each give it more to work with.

Thanks to [@2590812378](https://github.com/Nymbo/Markdown-Minimap/issues/3) for
suggesting this, originally as a CSS snippet, and for the follow-ups that led to
it being computed rather than typed in by hand and then measured against the
pane rather than the text box.

## 📌 How it works

Most of the work in this plugin is in making the minimap and the note agree.
These are the parts worth knowing about.

**Whole-note rendering.** Obsidian virtualizes long notes, so a minimap built by
cloning the editor's DOM only ever sees the visible portion. Markdown Minimap
renders the note's full source separately, with no hidden helper views and no
iframes.

**Faithful layout.** The panel uses the note's own text width, top margin, line
height and font size, so lines wrap where they wrap in the note rather than at
the pane's full width.

**Source mode shows source.** With Live Preview off, Obsidian prints the file
verbatim. The minimap does the same — one element per source line, taking each
line's height from CodeMirror itself, rather than rendering Markdown the note
isn't showing. Line for line, this mode is exact. Source mode is still
highlighted in the editor, so the panel keeps those colours too: headings, links,
tags, quotes, code and emphasis all read as themselves. At a tenth of full size
the colour is most of what is left to navigate by.

**Code blocks are highlighted by language.** Reading view colours code by running
it through Prism, so the panel runs the same tokenizer over fenced blocks and
frontmatter and emits the same classes — meaning Source mode and Reading view
show a block in exactly the same colours, from your theme's own palette. A fence
with no language, or one Prism has no grammar for, stays plain text as before.

**Making room without a transform.** The text is moved clear of the minimap with
margins rather than a `translateX`. A transform makes the note's sizer the
containing block for everything absolutely positioned inside it, and Obsidian's
find-in-note overlay positions its match boxes in coordinates measured against
the scroller — so in Reading view the highlights landed a margin's width away
from the words they were marking. Two equal and opposite margins move the same
box the same distance, leave its width alone, and claim nothing.

**Properties.** Obsidian's Markdown renderer emits frontmatter as a hidden block
and never builds the properties widget, so properties would take up space in the
note and none in the minimap. The minimap reproduces them and pins the block to
the height they actually occupy — the widget, the raw YAML, or nothing,
according to what the note is showing.

**Code blocks.** A rendered `<pre>` is inset on both sides while an editor code
line is inset only on the left. Left alone that wraps wide code — ASCII diagrams
especially — one column early, which both scrambles them and inflates the note's
mapped height. The minimap matches the editor's box.

**Blank lines.** Markdown collapses consecutive blank lines when rendered. They
are re-inserted as inert spacers sized from CodeMirror's line blocks, so
deliberate whitespace survives.

**Collapsed sections.** A folded section takes no room in the note, so drawing
it would add height the note doesn't have and push everything below it out of
step. The minimap reads Obsidian's own fold state and folds to match, in every
mode — including Reading view, where the note's own sections are virtualized but
the panel's are not. Collapsing the properties works the same way. Folds that
don't hang off a heading, such as a list item, aren't mirrored in the rendered
modes; Source mode takes every line's height from CodeMirror, so it follows all
of them exactly.

**The full scroll range.** Obsidian lets you scroll past the end of a note, and
its own scrollbar covers that space. The minimap mirrors it rather than leaving
it out, so the marker reaches the end of its track exactly when the editor does
and wheel distance keeps matching marker travel all the way down. That space is
scaled by the same ratio the panel achieves on the note's content, so it isn't
the one stretch of the panel drawn at a different scale from everything above
it — which is what used to make the marker change size on the approach to the
end of a long note.

**Scroll mapping.** Scaling the note by a single ratio assumes the minimap grows
at the same rate the note does, which it doesn't — small per-block differences
accumulate into hundreds of pixels over a long note. Instead both coordinate
spaces are anchored to positions that exist in each, and positions between them
are interpolated. Those positions are the note's headings: ATX headings that
start a line and setext headings (text underlined with `===` or `---`). A `#`
inside a list item, a blockquote, a callout or an embedded note renders as a
heading but isn't one of the note's own — Obsidian won't fold it or list it in
the outline — so the panel skips those too and the two lists stay in step. If
they ever disagree in count anyway, Obsidian's own heading index is consulted
before falling back to the global ratio, rather than risking a wrong pairing.
Reading view virtualizes its sections, so it uses the global ratio.

## 💡 Contributing

Bug reports and feature requests are welcome — open an
[issue](https://github.com/Nymbo/Markdown-Minimap/issues). Screenshots help a
lot for anything visual, as does the note's view mode, since the three modes
take different paths through the code.
